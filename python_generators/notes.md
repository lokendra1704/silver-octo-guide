# Generators

The function with yield is called a generator function
<br>
Generator function when called, always returns a generator object.
<br>
A Generator Function has an intial entry point which is just like a regular function. A yield Statements defines an exit point and simultaneously a re-entry point.
<br>
Functions which have entry and exit points are called as Coroutines

## Iterator Protocol

Any object in Python can be a iterator. It just needs to define proper `__iter__` and `__next__` methods.
